# DDoS and NS2 Simulation: Intro to netwrok simulation

It consists of basic ns2 programs along with a practical DDoS attack simulation example.

## Getting Started

Recommended basic knowledge of Networking

## Prerequisites

Just a 'Computer System': Unix,Windows or MAC ...

### Installing

Refer:-

For ns2 installation:
"nsnam.com: http://www.nsnam.com/2014/11/ns2-installation-in-ubuntu-1404.html"

For Tracegraph installation (3rd party)
"getch.wordpress.com: https://getch.wordpress.com/2011/04/20/installing-tracegraph2-02-application-in-ubuntu/"

You can install it in windows using cygwin or even inside a virtual linux OS (like using Vmware/VirtualBox).

For macsystem:-
Refer "http://www.nsnam.com/2011/11/installation-of-network-simulator-ns235.html"

### Running the tests

In terminal:-

ns filename.tcl   -- for running simulation
./tracegraph /path/to/tracefile  --- like say:out.tr for trace analysis

Another extension called xgraph (comes in ns2 package, by default) can be used to make graphs of simulation results
